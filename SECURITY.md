We take the security of our platform seriously and appreciate your help in identifying potential vulnerabilities. If you believe you've discovered a security issue, please report it to us promptly so we can investigate and take appropriate action.

### How to Report a Vulnerability:

Please send details of the vulnerability to **security@lecca.io**. When submitting your report, include as much information as possible, such as the steps to reproduce the issue, affected components, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

### What to Expect After Reporting:

- **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within **2 business days**.
- **Next Steps**: If your report is accepted, we will outline the next steps for remediation and provide you with a timeline within **3 business days**.
- **Outcome**: If we determine that the vulnerability cannot be reproduced or is not a security concern, we will provide a clear explanation as to why the issue is declined.

### Third-Party Integrations:

As we integrate with third-party platforms, we ensure our implementation is secure. However, if a vulnerability is found in one of the third-party APIs we use, we encourage you to contact the relevant third-party platform directly.

### Commitment to Fixes:

We are committed to fixing any bugs or security issues in our own code or implementation promptly. We strive to ensure the security of your data and the integrity of our platform.
